 how do we want the game to update:
* when the user presses s to start:
    -> user has to be able to enter the 
    -> pre initialised human object calls an starting function which calls the add cards function that returns two
    -> random cards from the deck. These are then stored in the data member card array of the human object
    -> the return cards function from the human object is called which enables the screen to know what cards to display
